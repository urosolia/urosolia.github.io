I am a postdoctoral scholar at Caltech, working with Prof. [Aaron Ames](http://www.bipedalrobotics.com/) and Prof. [Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/). My current research focuses on designing control algorithms which allow autonomous systems to perform highly dynamical maneuvers while guaranteeing safety.

During my PhD at the University of California Berkeley, I worked with Prof. Francesco Borrelli in the [MPC lab](http://www.mpc.berkeley.edu/). I developed the Learning Model Predictive Control ([LMPC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8039204)) strategy, which is a model-based policy iteration strategy. This strategy was used to teach an autonomous vehicle how to race!

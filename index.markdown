I am a post-doctoral scholar at Caltech, working under the supervision of Prof. Aaron Ames. My current research focuses on designing control algorithms which allow autonomous systems to perform highly dynamical maneuvers while guaranteeing safety.

During my PhD at the University of California Berkeley, I worked with Prof. Francesco Borrelli in the [MPC lab](http://www.mpc.berkeley.edu/). I developed the Learning Model Predictive Control (LMPC) strategy, which guarantees safety and performance improvement for autonomous system performing iterative tasks. This strategy was used to teach an autonomous vehicle how to race!

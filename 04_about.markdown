I was born in Sicily, a beautiful island in the south of Italy. 
I enjoyed the mediterranean see and the vulcano Etna until I moved to Milan to start my undergraduate studies at Politecnico di Milano. If you wanna know more about my academ and working experiences please check my [CV](https://github.com/urosolia/urosolia.github.io/raw/main/downloads/CV_10_19_2020.pdf).

In my free time I enjoy reading, cooking and being outdoor. I like almost any kind of sport and lately I have been surfing on the beatiful California coast.
